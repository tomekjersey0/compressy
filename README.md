##Cool Compression

Yeah I mean, this is kinda cool.

###Findings

####Huh

The **huh.txt** file was like 2400 lines of the same repeated phrase, a few words in length
its original size was about **113KB**, but after compression, **huh.rar** went down to only **157B!** Wow!

Cool compression, right?

####Smaller

The **smaller.txt** was much smaller, one line of text containing "what about this one". The size of this file (not on disk) was **19B**, but after compression, its size actaully went up! **smaller.rar** measuring at a whole **94B**! That's almost 5 times larger! 

Pretty bad compression, right?

####Conclusion

So what do we even conclude from all this? IDK! But it's still a pretty cool thing I think. So cool I wrote this whole thing about it and went on a massive tangent revising computer science with an English exam tomorrow! Genius!
